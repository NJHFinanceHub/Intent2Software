## 🔐 Authentication

When you push, GitHub will ask for credentials:

**Username:** NJHFinanceHub

**Password:** You need a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)

### How to Get Your Token:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click:** "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Fill in:**
   ```
   Note: Intent Platform Push
   Expiration: 90 days (or your choice)
   Scopes: ☑ repo (check this box)
   ```
4. **Click:** "Generate token"
5. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_...`)
6. **Use this token as your password** when pushing

⚠️ **Save this token!** You won't see it again.

### "Authentication failed"
→ Use Personal Access Token (not password)
→ Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### "Repository not found"
→ Make sure you created it on GitHub first
→ URL: https://github.com/new

### "Already exists"
→ Run: `git remote remove origin`
→ Then try again

### "Permission denied"
→ Check your token has `repo` scope
→ Try creating a new token
